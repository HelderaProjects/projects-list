The Heldera Project endeavors to tackle the global food security challenge by amalgamating the Agrovestment platform with real-world agriculture. This necessitates a robust platform and a dedicated team to ensure the seamless operation of the system.
Platform under development will function as a conduit between digital or metafarmers and traditional farmers. Metafarmers lacking adequate land and resources can invest through the Heldera platform, thereby facilitating real-world farmers to carry out professional agricultural activities. Naturally, this process will be closely monitored by established teams.
Metafarmers, acting as investors, will naturally benefit from the agricultural process until the harvest is yielded. Moreover, metafarmers will reap profits from the appreciating value of token assets by the market.
The integrated investment platform encompasses agriculture, fisheries, and livestock farming. A transparent and profitable investment ecosystem is poised to persistently expand, delivering added value to the token as an asset.
To broaden outreach and enhance user engagement, the development team plans to create a blockchain-based metafarm game in addition to the direct investment platform development. This game will be seamlessly integrated with real-world agriculture. Users will be rewarded for their participation, while farmers will earn revenue from their agricultural work.
Lastly, the pursuit of exchanging tokens for agricultural food commodities in the market represents a compelling shared objective. Each token holder can also purchase food products produced through the same platform.
